    <h1>Privacy Policy for PocketPath</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 29/01/2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      We value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how PocketPath handles
      user data and ensures your information remains private and secure.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      PocketPath does not collect, transmit, or share personal data externally.
      All data is stored locally on your device in an SQLite database within the
      app’s internal storage.
    </p>

    <h3>Locally Stored Data:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Expense records (e.g., transaction details, categories, amounts, dates).
      </li>
      <li>User preferences & settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data remains on your device only and is not sent to any server, third
      party, or cloud storage.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Since PocketPath stores data locally, we use it only for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Tracking expenses and managing records within the app.</li>
      <li>
        ✔ Generating and exporting financial reports (CSV/PDF) for user
        convenience.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing & Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect, share, or sell your data.</li>
      <li>Your data is stored securely only on your device.</li>
      <li>
        The app does not use external servers, cloud databases, or third-party
        analytics.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Sharing via Expo Share</h3>
    <p>
      PocketPath allows users to export and share their expense data as CSV or
      PDF files via third-party apps (e.g., email, messaging apps, cloud
      storage).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sharing is user-initiated—the app does not send files automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once shared, the user is responsible for the security of the exported
        file.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights & Control Over Data</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data. You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ✅ Delete your data by clearing the app’s storage or uninstalling the
        app.
      </li>
      <li>✅ Export your data (CSV/PDF) and share it manually.</li>
      <li>✅ Manage your sharing preferences within your device settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since the app does not store data externally, we do not have access to
      retrieve or modify your data remotely.
    </p>
